## 💡 Why I Built This (The Real Story)

Honestly, I just got sick of **Rave** and **Teleparty**. They are fine most of the time, but the constant buffering and sync issues were ruining movie nights for me and my girlfriend.

I didn't want a complex app with logins and ads. I just wanted something that actually works. So I built this to solve our problem:

1.  **Zero Buffering:** It uses P2P (Peer-to-Peer), so the video goes straight from me to her. No slow servers in the middle.
2.  **No Signups:** We hate making accounts. This app just lets you create a room and join. Simple.
3.  **YouTube that Syncs:** We watch a lot of YouTube, so I coded a custom sync feature for that too.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Real-Time Video Sync:** Play, pause, and seek actions happen instantly for everyone in the room.
* **Voice & Text Chat:** Built-in high-quality voice chat and a private messaging system so we don't need a separate call running.
* **YouTube Integration:** Paste any YouTube link to watch together perfectly in sync.
* **Local File Support:** We can also watch video files directly from our computers.

Basically, I built this so we could stop worrying about buffering and syncing issues and just enjoy the movie together.
