## 💡 Why I Built This (The Real Story)

Honestly, I just got sick of **Rave** and **Teleparty**. They are fine most of the time, but the constant buffering and sync issues were ruining movie nights for me and my girlfriend.
I didn't want a complex app with logins and ads. I just wanted something that actually works. So I built this to solve our problem:

1.  **Zero Buffering:** It uses P2P (Peer-to-Peer), so the video goes straight from me to her. No slow servers in the middle.

2.  **No Signups:** We hate making accounts. This app just lets you create a room and join. Simple.

3.  **YouTube that Syncs:** We watch a lot of YouTube, so I coded a custom sync feature for that too.

Basically, I built this so we could stop worrying about buffering and syncing issues and just enjoy the movie together.
